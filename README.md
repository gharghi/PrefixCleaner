# PrefixCleaner
Cleans every objects of a prefix in RIPE DB

You just need to run it with Python3
It will prompt for the prefix and object type and password.
You have 4 options: "inetnum", "route", "domain" or "all" for all of them. Also you need to enter your default maintainer password (or a maintainer that is authorized for all of objects)
